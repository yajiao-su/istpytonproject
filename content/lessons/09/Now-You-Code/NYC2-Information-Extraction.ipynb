    "# Now You Code 2: Information Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we make computers seem intelligent? One approach is to use *term extraction*. Term extration is a type of information extration where we attempt to find relevant terms in text. The relevant terms come from a *corpus*, or set of plausible terms we want to extract.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have the text:\n",
    "\n",
    "`One day I would like to visit Syracuse`\n",
    "\n",
    "We has smart humans can be fairly confident that `Syracuse` is a place, more specifically a `city`. \n",
    "\n",
    "A rudimentary method to make the computer interpret `Syracuse` as a place is to provide a corpus of cities and have the computer look up `Syracuse` in that corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this code exercise we will do just that. Let's first write a function to read cities from the file `NYC2-cities.txt` into a corpus of cities, which will be represented in Python as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then write a main program loop to input some text, split the text into a list of words and if any of the words match a city in the corpus list we will output the word is a city.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should handle upper / lower case matching. A good approach is to title case the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT: Please note that our program will ONLY work for one word cities. Later we will provide an approach for multiple-word cities, such as `New York` or `San Diego`. Don't worry about that now. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SAMPLE RUN\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter some text (or ENTER to quit): one day I would like to visit syraucse and rochester\n",
    "Syracuse is a city\n",
    "Rochester is a city\n",
    "Enter some text (or ENTER to quit): austin is in texas\n",
    "Austin is a city\n",
    "Enter some text (or ENTER to quit): \n",
    "Quitting...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual begin your program with your plan as a to-do list. I suggest writing the loading of the corpus as a function."
