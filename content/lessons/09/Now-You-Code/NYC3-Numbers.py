'''
Now You Code 3: List of numbers

This example will demonstrate how to parse an input string into
a list of numbers. You will then demonstrate it's a list of
numbers by calculating the count, sum(), min(), max() and average
of the numbers using Python's len(), sum(), min(), and max() functions.

Example Run #1:

    Enter numbers separated by a space: 10 5 0

    Numbers: [10.0, 5.0, 0.0]
    Count: 3
    Min: 0.0
    Max: 10.0
    Sum: 15.0
    Average: 5.0

Example Run #2: (Handles bad input)

    Enter numbers separated by a space: 5 mike 3

    Error: mike is not a number!

As usual, write the program, THEN figure out how to handle bad input.

HINT: Use split() to make a list from the input, use a loop to convert
each item in the list to a float

Start out your program by writing your TODO list of steps
you'll need to solve the problem!

# TODO: Write Todo list then beneath write your code

# Write code here 

numbers = []
