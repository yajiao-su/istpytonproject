'''
Now You Code 4: Syracuse Weather

Write a program to load the Syracuse weather data from Dec 2015 in
JSON format into a Python list of dictionary. The file is:

"NYC4-syr-weather-dec-2015.json"

After you load this data calculate the number of days where the
'Mean TemperatureF' is above freezing ( > 32 degrees)

Store the days above freezing and below freezing into a dictionary
and then print out the dictionary like this:

{'below-freezing': 4, 'above-freezing': 27}

(It was a warm December by Syracuse Standards!)
