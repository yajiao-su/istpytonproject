Now You Code 4: Reddit News Sentiment Analysis

In this assignment you're tasked with performing a sentiment analysis on top Reddit news articles. (https://www.reddit.com/r/news/top.json)
You should perform the analysis on the titles only.

Start by getting the Reddit API to work, and extracting a list of titles only. You'll have to research the Reddit API, and can do so here: https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/ The Reddit API requires a custom 'User-Agent' You must specify this in your headers, as explained here: https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API

After you get Reddit working move on to sentiment analysis. Once again, we will use (http://text-processing.com/api/sentiment/) like we did in the in-class coding lab.

Start by getting the sentiment analysis working for a single title. Then write your program to loop over each title runnning the sentiment analysis and printing both the sentiment and the title, like this:

Example Run (Your output will vary as news stories change...)

neutral : FBI Chief Comey 'Rejects' Phone Tap Allegation
pos : New Peeps-flavored Oreos reportedly turning people's poop pink
